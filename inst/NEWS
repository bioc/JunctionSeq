v0.6.25:
 Major structural changes:
 * DESeq2 code is now called as foreign function calls and calls to exported DESeq2 functions. Copy-over of DESeq2 code greatly reduced.
 * As a consequence: JunctionSeq no longer requires Rcpp, RcppArmadillo.
 * JunctionSeq no longer requires compilation, it no longer includes any C++ code.

 In addition, a few minor bugfixes:
 * Fixed chromosome labels in gene profile plots.
 * Fixed behavior when label.p.vals is FALSE

v0.6.8:
 Several bugfixes, along with some error checking.
 * Fixed one place where I used an "T" instead of "TRUE", so BiocCheck stops complaining.
 * Local dispersion fit setting now propagates properly from runJunctionSeqAnalysis to fitJunctionSeqDispersionFunction.
 * Local dispersion fit now works with the standard "DESeq2-style" method.GLM.
 * Manual setting of inclusion thresholds now works with the "DESeq2-style" method.GLM.
 * keep.hypothesisTest.fit now prints a warning when attempted with the "DESeq2-style" method.GLM, as saving the fit statistics cannot easily be implemented using this method (since all the model fitting happens in C++).
 * If you attempt to plot a non-existent gene, it now prints an informative error.
 * Fixed other output-compatibility issues with the legacy "simpleML" mode.
 * Tested all sorts of combinations of method modes. Added warnings to at least some of the incompatible combinations.
 * Reduced extraneous messages in debug mode.
